CAESAR CIPHER
The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption technique. It’s simply a type of substitution cypher, i.e., each letter of a given text is replaced by a letter with a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example with a shift of 1, A would be replaced by B, B would become C, and so on. The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar, who apparently used it to communicate with his officials. 
Thus to cypher a given text we need an integer value, known as a shift which indicates the number of positions each letter of the text has been moved down. 
The encryption can be represented using modular arithmetic by first transforming the letters into numbers, according to the scheme, A = 0, B = 1,…, Z = 25.

VIGNERE CIPHER
Vigenere Cipher is a method of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a simple form of polyalphabetic substitution. A polyalphabetic cypher is any cypher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The encryption of the original text is done using the Vigenère square or Vigenère table.
 
The table consists of the alphabets written out 26 times in different rows, each alphabet shifted cyclically to the left compared to the previous alphabet, corresponding to the 26 possible Caesar Ciphers.
At different points in the encryption process, the cypher uses a different alphabet from one of the rows.
The alphabet used at each point depends on a repeating keyword.
The first letter of the plaintext, G is paired with A, the first letter of the key. So use row G and column A of the Vigenère square, namely G. Similarly, for the second letter of the plaintext, the second letter of the key is used, the letter at row E and column Y is C. The rest of the plaintext is enciphered in a similar fashion. 
 





PLAY FAIR
The Playfair cypher was the first practical digraph substitution cypher. The scheme was invented in 1854 by Charles Wheatstone but was named after Lord Playfair who promoted the use of the cypher. In Playfair cyphers, unlike traditional cyphers, we encrypt a pair of alphabets(digraphs) instead of a single alphabet.
It was used for tactical purposes by British forces in the Second Boer War and in World War I and for the same purpose by the Australians during World War II. This was because Playfair is reasonably fast to use and requires no special equipment.







ADVANCED ENCRYPTION STANDARD
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is a symmetric block cypher chosen by the U.S. government to protect classified information.
AES is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. It is essential for government computer security, cybersecurity and electronic data protection.
The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) started the development of AES in 1997 when it announced the need for an alternative to the Data Encryption Standard (DES), which was starting to become vulnerable to brute-force attacks.
NIST stated that the newer, advanced encryption algorithm would be unclassified and must be "capable of protecting sensitive government information well into the [21st] century." It was intended to be easy to implement in hardware and software, as well as in restricted environments -- such as a smart card -- and offer decent defences against various attack techniques.
AES was created for the U.S. government with additional voluntary, free use in public or private, commercial or noncommercial programs that provide encryption services. However, non-governmental organizations choosing to use AES are subject to limitations created by U.S. export control.

TRIPLE DATA ENCRYPTION STANDARD
Triple DES is an encryption technique that uses three instances of DES on the same plain text. It uses there different types of key choosing techniques in first all used keys are different and in second two keys are the same and one is different and in third, all keys are the same.
Triple DES is also vulnerable to meet-in-the-middle attack because of which it gives a total security level of 2^112 instead of using 168 bit of key. The block collision attack can also be done because of the short block size and using the same key to encrypt a large size of the text. It is also vulnerable to sweet32 attacks.
